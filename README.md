# CockroachRun

## Description 

This is my first 2D game mockup, based on test task specifications. 
Game is represented by a ball, rolling through pipe-like 2D level with random generated holes.
Ball can move from bottom side of level to top-side and vise versa to avoid holes, meanwhile level moves from right to left.
Player controls ball with taps.
Game should have minimal UI with pause, start, scoring behaviour.
Android .apk should be represented as result.
Ball behaviour reminds cockroach run for me, so, I will try to make suitable graphics for this project.
